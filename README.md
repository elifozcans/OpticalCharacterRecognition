# OpticalCharacterRecognition
 OCR PROJECT

OCR = Optical Character Recognition. In other words, OCR systems transform a two-dimensional image of text, that could contain machine printed or handwritten text from its image representation into machine-readable text. OCR as a process generally consists of several sub-processes to perform as accurately as possible.
In my project, I will try to do OCR application on pictures with 3 different examples with the latest knowledge researched in optical character recognition. 

#OpenSourceOCRTools
There are a lot of optical character recognition software available. In my project I've used Tesseract library.
#Tesseract is an open source optical character recognition (OCR) platform. OCR extracts text from images and documents without a text layer and outputs the document into a new searchable text file, PDF, or most other popular format. The Tesseract OCR accuracy is fairly high out of the box and can be increased significantly with a well designed Tesseract image preprocessing pipeline.
By using these codes, you can perform OCR on images containing text :)
